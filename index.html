            <p>Hello there! Nice to meet you kind person. I am Kidus, and this website is a sneak peek into my daily life :) You might be wondering who this no name who thinks his days matter is? I got you covered, you can visit my <a href="profile.html">my profile</a></p>
            <p>You know, each day hits different. Each day brings experience unlike no other. Most of the time, I forget(speaking for myself) not even distant days but yesterday and today. I need to do something about this forgetfullness of mine. It is my duty to capture or should I say it is mii duty(get it..?). Bad jokes aside, I take it as a personal responsibility that I remember each of my days.</p>
            <p>Each day consists of pictures and an optional writing. Kind of like a jounral, actually no, exactly like a journal! Except that it has pictures. Basically, it is a journal with pictures.</p>
            <p>If you want to find a directory with the list of my entries here you go: <a href="entries_list.html">my entries</a></p>
